# Product Discovery - Ways to discover New Products

I think there's some techniques to find new products. But I've only learned about the "Risk Mitigation" as a technique to discover new products.
So I'll try to make a how-to/ guide about Risk Mitigation method.

## Risk Mitigation? What is that? And how would that help me find new products?

That's a good question! I'm taking a course about Product Manager at Alura and when I took that class I thought about it too! But I think it's pretty cool, let me tell you!
Before releasing a new product on the market, investing money and other resources, we need to know if this product is the right one. 
And there's 4 risks about our product that we must to mitigate!
- Value;
- Usability;
- Business;
- Viability.

## Value Risk
A product that has no value to our users! 
To mitigate this risk, we can answer the questions above:
- We are solving important problems?
- Is the solution relevant to our users?
- We are solving a problem that our clients actually have?
- This clients want our solution?
- Do clients see the value of the solution?
- Are we moving toward an expected result?

## Usability Risk
A product that our customers can't use! When we create a product like that, we have the risk to spend much money in a solution that no one can use!

## Business Risk
We must to question ourselves:
- Are we attending to our stakeholders necessities? 
- Are we impacting our core business?
- Are we having a good alignment with the business objectives?

## Viability Risk
The risk of not being ablet to build or create our product.
To avoid this risk, we also have a few questions:
- With our technological resources, is it possible to build this solution?
- How much does it cost to create this?
- Is there a simpler and more efficient way to solve this problem?

With all these risks mitigated, we should be able to DISCOVER a good product. 
As the course goes, I will try to make more how to's/ guides. I think it might help me in the future or help someone else :D

That's all folks!!
